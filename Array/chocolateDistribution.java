 * This is from a array based problem in GeeksForGeeks.
 *
 * Given an array A of positive integers of size N, where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet.
 * Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that :
 * 1. Each student gets one packet.
 * 2. The difference between the number of chocolates given to the students having packet with maximum chocolates and student having packet with minimum chocolates is minimum.
